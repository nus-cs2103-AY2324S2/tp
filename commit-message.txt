Add delete by name functionality to DeleteCommand

Enhance the DeleteCommand class to allow users to delete contacts
by specifying their name, in addition to the existing index-based
deletion. This improvement includes updates to the DeleteCommandParser
to handle string inputs, representing names, and parse them
appropriately for command execution. This change makes the
application more flexible and user-friendly, as it provides an
alternative method for users to manage their contacts.
