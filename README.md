# Welcome to Realodex
* This is **CS2103T W10-1's Brownfield implementation of AddressBook 3** .<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study

## So what is this project about?
* This project aims to help real estate agents with keeping track of their client data in their day-to-day activity.
* This project is also optimised for fast typing users and hence we will focus on a well optimised CLI system.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application by extending CS2103T's existing project (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **very well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Realodex` (`RDX` for short) as we were inspired by the real life Rolodex that helps store a contact list. Importantly, it sounds catchy too.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
