## PoochPlanner
This is an **address book for dog cafe owners**.<br>
Example usages:
* as an address book to store contacts

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _PoochPlanner_) used for managing contact details.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PoochPlanner` because it is meant for pooch (dog) cafe owners to manage their address books.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see **[PoochPlanner's Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/)**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
