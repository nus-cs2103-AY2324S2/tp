# FitBook
FitBook is an easy-to-use address book that is geared towards personal trainers.
Features such as the integration of personal health information for each contact allows trainers
to effectively track the progress of their clients.

The main way to interact with FitBook is via the keyboard. This allows trainers to quickly manage
their clients, while still having a GUI that provides a visually pleasing experience to the user.
