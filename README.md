## Avengers Assemble
Avengers Assemble is a contact management app, meant for use with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The application is designed for Head Tutors of the CS1101S Programming Methodology course but its use cases can be extended to Head Tutors of other courses.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
