* This is the **CCA Manager** project. We aim to help NUS CCA members improve their contact management.
* Example usages:
  * assign roles to contacts corresponding to their actual role in the CCA.
  * form groups and sub-groups of contacts.
* This project is ongoing and still a WIP.
  * We aim to use multiple paradigms of programming, such as **OOP** and **functional** programming.
    However, the main paradigm will be **OOP**.
  * User and developer documentation is still a WIP, and will be updated soon.
* For detailed information, please see the [CCA Manager Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
