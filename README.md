* This is **an App for Academic Instructors to Keep track of their Past students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * create/read/update/delete students in the student list
  * find and filter students from the database as per requirements
  * load/save students from local storage (JSON,CSV)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _EduLink NUS_) used for managing contact details of Students.
  * It is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project, with additional tweaks and features to provide a customised experience for Academic Instructors. 
  * From Address-Book Level-3 :- It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `EduLink NUS` because It Links Academic Instructors with their Past Students.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EduLink NUS Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-t16-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
