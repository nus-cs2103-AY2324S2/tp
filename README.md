* This is **an app for recruiters to manage candidates**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * retrieves the candidate list if an excel sheet containing the candidate list is put in the correct location
  * create/read/update/delete candidates in the candidate list
  * track the status of each candidate in the hiring pipeline
* The project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _HireHub_) used for managing candidate details.
  * It is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project, with additional tweaks and features to provide a customised experience for recruiters.
  * From the AddressBook-Level3 project: > It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Hirehub` because it is meant to help recruiters to manage and hire candidates seamlessly.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md)** if you are interested in using HireHub, or the **[Developer Guide](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md)** if you are interested in developing HireHub.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
