* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students in CS2103T**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * For a TA to keep track of their students, or
  * For a personal project to keep track of your contacts.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TA Toolkit_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TA Toolkit` because it is a toolkit that allows TAs to manage their students' contacts and other information in a more organised manner.
