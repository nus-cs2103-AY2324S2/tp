## Overview

InternHub is a comprehensive project designed to assist Computer Science (CS) students in managing their internship applications. This project serves various purposes:

- The project provides a well-written code base, surpassing the typical size of beginner-level SE modules (around 6 KLoC) without becoming overwhelming.
- Extensive user and developer documentation is included to facilitate understanding and usage.
