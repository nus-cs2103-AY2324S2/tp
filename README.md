### Eventy

* This CLI application serves as an event planner tailored for event planners in halls, facilitating efficient management of participants and events. This is a CLI application that is desgined for users who type fast<br>
  Example usages:
    * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
    * as a case study

### What does this do
* The project is tailored specifically for student event organizers and offers a new standard of convenient and easy event planning.
* The application is targeted towards users who type fast and are used to CLI application.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Eventy` (`ET` for short) because we want to insert playfulness and efficiency into event planning. Plus it reminds you of a certain character! doesn't it :)
