## Strack.io
* `Strack.io` is a desktop application for **managing customer information and orders**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * For homemade food sellers to keep track of customer orders.
  * Keep records of customer information for easy reference.
* `Strack.io` can help homemade food sellers **organize customer information and orders** so that they know **what** to bake, **how much** to bake and **where to deliver** the order to. This information management tool aims to be **more efficient to use than paper-work or general-purpose excel sheets**. We also aim to **reduce chances of mistakes** such as wrong delivery address, forgetting an order or sending repeated orders.
* Feature list:
  * Add new customer contact information
  * Edit contact information
  * Search contact based on keywords
  * Create orders, which will be tagged to the respective customer
  * Edit order information
  * List out all active orders
  * Delete order when delivery is done
* It is named `Strack.io` because it was created to help keep track of snack orders.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Strack.io Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-t08-2.github.io/tp/)**.
