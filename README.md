> "Building Bridges, Bridging Gaps: PedagoguePages, Your Contact Map"

## What is PedagoguePages?
* `PedagoguePages` (`PePes` for short) is a **contact management application**.
* Naming:
  * Product Name:
    * `Pedagogue` - Pedagogy, education.
    * `Pages` - Lists of contacts
    * Together, forming a contact list for educators!
  * Catchy abbreviation:
    * `Pe` from Pedagogue, and `Pes` from pages (`PAY-ge-S`)
    
* PedagogyPages is a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) based system.


## What is PedagogyPages for?
* PedagogyPages is optimized for **Educators**, specifically in the primary / secondary school area, where class sizes are large.<br>
* PedagogyPages is more optimized for users who are:
  * Generally faster typists
  * Users that prefer command line interfaces
* PedagogyPages boasts features such as:
  * Basic **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations on student contact information.
  * Search functionality based on different modes (e.g classes, student ID, etc)


## What is PedagogyPages based on?
* PedagogyPages is also our (CS2103-W10-3's) brownfield development project, based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
