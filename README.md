# FriendFolio

## Description

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FriendFolio_) used for managing
  contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC)
      than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
