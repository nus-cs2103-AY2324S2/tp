# ModContact

This app helps students find more-knowledge-others(MKOs) that they already know, and have the contacts for, by filtering their contacts by modules. ModContact allows for discovery of new MKOs (assuming this does not violate the constraints for the evolve direction).

# Acknowlegement
This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
