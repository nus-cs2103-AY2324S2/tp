# *LookMeUp*

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

### Having TOO MANY contacts to keep track of?
> e.g. friends from different parts of your school life?

> e.g. friends from different committees and interest groups?

### Fret not,
this is **a project aimed to *streamline* YOUR campus life**.<br>

## Why would LookMeUp be useful?
As an address book for students living on NUS campus to manage contacts, LookMeUp is designed to enable TAGGING!
* **Tagging** allows you to add **multiple tags** to each contact, to keep track of the different groups they belong to.
* You may **filter** your contacts via the **tags**,
so you can *easily find* the contacts you need from a particular group
(e.g. when broadcasting announcements, scheduling meetings etc.)

### How is LookMeUp created?
* LookMeUp is **written in OOP fashion** - meaning, it is **easy to maintain AND _extend NEW features_!**.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* Our documentation would be uploaded soon, do keep an eye out for it!
