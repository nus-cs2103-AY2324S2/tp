# Nursing Address Book

Target user:
Our target group is Ward Nurses. This product is for users who prefer typing quickly while having quick access to critical patient information fast.

Value proposition:
Streamlined text-based commands to manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

_This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)._
