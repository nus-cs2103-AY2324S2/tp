*FINDvisor aims to streamline client management for financial advisors with a tool that organizes contact information. Furthermore, it aims to simplify organising meetings, and tracks client goals for better timeline planningâ€”all in one clutter-free interface.* While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FINDvisor Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103-f15-1.github.io/tp/)**.
