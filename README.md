* This is a team project for our CS2103T Software Engineering class.
* Tailored specifically for computing students, our team project, Connectify, 
optimises networking for future career opportunities. Connectify seamlessly 
organises contact details, efficiently manages professional relationships 
and simplifies event and meeting planning. Designed for seamless usage via 
Command Line Interface (CLI), Connectifyâ€™s ease of use sets up computing 
students for success.
