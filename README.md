# TutorsContactsPro

* TutorsContactsPro is a app for computer science tutor managing students for tutorials (all cs course or type of teaching)
* TutorsContactsPro allows tutors to have faster and more convenient access to their list of students (from different classes), optimized for those who prefer a clean UI with the use of CLI.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TutorsContactsPro` (`TCP` for short) which means it is a pro-version app for tutors to manage their students
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w10-4.github.io/tp/index.html)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
