* This is an application for **NUS School of Computing (SoC) students to find contacts within SoC** and **book consultation slots with Professors and Teaching Assistants**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * retrieves all contact details of a user within NUS SoC
  * create and delete user contact details
  * retrieves all consultation timings of a user
  * create and delete consultation timings
* The project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Dook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is built on the AddressBook-Level3 project.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It is named `Dook` because it is a moniker from the individual project (iP) that all CS2103T students do.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md)**, or the **[Developer Guide](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md)** if you are interested in contributing to Dook.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
