* This is the software engineering project done by group F13 for [CS2103T](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/admin/index.html)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MatchMate_) used for managing classmate contacts, their skills, and forming teams.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is built off the AddressBook-Level3 project, simulating the brownfield process of working with an existing codebase.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[MatchMate Product Website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
