The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Clinic Mate_) used for managing contact details.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

Clinic Mate is an **address book for managing user's contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Clinic Mate can manage your contacts faster than traditional GUI apps.

Clinic Mate aims to make it easy for **General Practitioners** (GPs) in private family clinics to view patient contacts at
a glance including:
* Medical history
* Past diagnosis
* Prescriptions
* Future appointments
* Many more

For the detailed documentation of this project (e.g. User or Developer Guide), see the **[Clinic Mate Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-2.github.io/tp/)**.
