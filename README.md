# SWEE
### Social Worker's Efficiency Enhancer

**Social Worker's Efficiency Enhancer (**SWEE**) is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). <br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* It is named `Social Worker's Efficiency Enhancer` (`SWEE` for short) because it a play on the acronym SWE (software engineering), what the course aims to teach, and [swee (Singapore slang)](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/jacklee/singlish_S.htm)
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SWEE Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-t17-1.github.io/tp/)**.
