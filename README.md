StaffConnect offers convenience and peace of mind to a struggling student with memory recollection issues.
This product allows users to easily identify and connect with educators by providing visual cues alongside contact
details, supported by a quick and easy filter system. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

# Features:
* Quickly add and review contacts
* Filter and search your required contacts quickly
* Add consultation times to the particular contact
* View and manage your meeting times

# Getting Started
 * Ensure that at least **Java 11 with JavaFx runtime is installed**
