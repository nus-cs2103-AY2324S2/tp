* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative]**(https://se-education.org).<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _CulinaryContacts_) specially designed for family-owned restaurant owners or managers to manage contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CulinaryContacts Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w09-3.github.io/tp/)**.
