An app named Press Planner for freelance journalists that can streamline their workflow by organizing sources, tracking outlets interested in their stories, and managing collaborations with peers/editors. With features like tagging and grouping contacts, it facilitates efficient research, ensuring reporters can quickly reach out and report on breaking stories. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, the CLI can be faster than the GUI.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
