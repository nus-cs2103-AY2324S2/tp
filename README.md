* This is **a CS2103T team project for NUS Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _HackLink_) used for managing contact details of Hackathon participants and sponsors.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * It is CLI based, so this is highly practical and efficient to use for hackathon organisers. 
* It is named `HackLink` because this app acts as a useful link between hackathon organiser and other participants.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HackLink Website](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-4/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
