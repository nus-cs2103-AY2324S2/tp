* This is **an app for CS instructors that helps manage weaker students**.<br>
* The project is based on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details. We have made several enhancements to it (see example usages).

* Example usages:
  * forming focus groups of weaker students
  * visualising the performance of weaker students over time
  * dedicating tutors and other resources to helping weaker students

* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **well-written** code base of around 10k LOC.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named **“TeachStack”** as a pun on heap and stack.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TeachStack Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-t09-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
