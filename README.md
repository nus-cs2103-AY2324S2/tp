- This is **Moddie!**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  - as a case study
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `Moddie` and it is adapted from `AddressBook3`!
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Moddie Product Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103-f15-4.github.io/tp/index.html)**.
- This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
