**Devplan Pro** is a project management app that is catered towards project managers who love typing. It allows the user to keep track of their various projects, the ongoing tasks within the projects, and people who are responsible for those tasks. Every action is executed through the input box using an intuitive [list of commands](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template).

- If you are interested in using DevPlan Pro, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
