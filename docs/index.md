**JENGA helps Genealogists keep track of details of relatives**,
and easy storage and retrieval of the relationship between relatives.
It does not cover discovery of new information,
other than highlighting links/anomalies between existing information.

While it has a GUI,
most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using AddressBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
