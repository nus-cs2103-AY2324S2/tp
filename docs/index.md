**Pedagogue Pages is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Pedagogue Pages, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Pedagogue Pages, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w10-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
