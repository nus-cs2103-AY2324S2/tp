**FINDvisor aims to streamline client management for financial advisors with a tool that organizes contact information. Furthermore, it aims to simplify organising meetings, and tracks client goals for better timeline planning—all in one clutter-free interface.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using FINDvisor, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing FINDvisor, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
