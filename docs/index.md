**StaffConnect offers convenience and peace of mind to a struggling student with memory recollection issues.**
This product allows users to easily identify and connect with educators by providing visual cues alongside contact
details, supported by a quick and easy filter system. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using StaffConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
