**Elder Scrolls is a desktop volunteer management system application for managing both volunteers, and befriendees.** 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).


Elder Scrolls, our Volunteer Management System (VMS), simplifies organizing volunteers and befriendees. Developed for efficiency by our team, it streamlines coordination and fosters community connections.

No more cumbersome scheduling or scattered communication. Manage volunteers and befriendees seamlessly in one intuitive platform. Say goodbye to endless emails and spreadsheets – Elder Scrolls centralizes tasks, making them faster and more effective. Experience efficient volunteer management – where organizing, coordinating, and connecting has never been easier.
