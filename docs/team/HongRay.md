### Project: Rainbow Dragon Postmortem

In this postmortem section, I will be discussing about **what can be improved in out work process.**
As mentioned in what went wrong, there were problems with time management and ineffective communication 
within the group. Though, these "what went wrong" components are not as serious as they sound, it is important to note 
and improve on it. Below are the consideration/implementations at that we had chosen to move forward to improve our workflow.

1. Given the nature of CS2103T course structure, we decided to adopt a SCRUM (or somewhat of a SCRUM) SDLC Process model to improve
our workflow. We are currently holding sprints in each week to ensure that we at lease fulfil an individual component/goals that we
set for ourselves. Of course, we have other commitments other than CS2103T, therefore, some of us might not be able to fulfil these goals
under unforseen circumstances.

    Additionally, we are having an "extra" SCRUM weekly meeting, instead of a daily meeting to consolidate what has been down, merge the relevant
PR's.

2. To combat the ineffective communication that existed previously, we have decided to include a summary of every meeting that we attend in out 
person telegram group, on top of the summary in the Google Docs. Additionally, we would effectively set GitHub issues, with deadline, as a means to remind other
members of the tasks at hand.
