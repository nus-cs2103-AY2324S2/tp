### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Allow user to add new contact to the address book.
  * What it does: Allow user to add the internship information that they applied for
  * Justification: This feature allow users to conveniently store all relevant internship details in one centralized location alongside their other contacts. This helps them stay organized and easily access internship information when needed.
  * Credits: The feature builds upon the robust foundation of AB3, optimizing code to accommodate new parameters.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Update existing tests for existing features with coverage of 78.57% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `add` and `edit` [\#72]()

* **Community**:

  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())

* **Tools**:
  * Set up codecov to the team repo
