## Project: Rainbow Dragon Postmortem
### **Things that did not go very well in v1.2 of our product:** 
1. One of the biggest problems that we faced was technical difficulties. Not many of us have prior experience in software engineering. 
When we were first given a brownfield project, it took us a lot of time trying to understand the original code base and modify the code base to suit our product.
2. Another possible thing that did not go very well was time management, because some of our teammates were still involved in other businesses such as exams and external competitions. 
Sometimes the tasks were overdue or were not deliverable by the deadline.
3. Another big challenge we faced was ineffective communication. When a new idea was brainstormed, it was not adequately articulated to other team members, 
leading to unclear instructions and misunderstandings.
