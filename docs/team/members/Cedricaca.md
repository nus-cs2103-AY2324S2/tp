## Project: Rainbow Dragon Postmortem
### What went well
* The group dynamic is very bro-like, which means that everyone is looking out for each other.
* Everyone will attend meeting on time and will attend all meeting no matter the circumstances (for example, we would bring computer to everywhere we go and attend meeting even if we are hanging out with friends)
* Everyone is able to have some work assigned to them and everyone finished them
* We will help each other to verify our code and review seriously before merging into master.
* We will also help each other with their own issue if anyone has a problem.
