## Project: Rainbow Dragon Postmortem
### **Switch of Workflow:**
1. Considering the structure of the CS2103T course, our team has chosen to implement a variation of the SCRUM agile methodology to enhance our project workflow. 
To maintain a steady development pace, we've instituted weekly sprints. Each sprint is designed to accomplish specific individual targets or components that contribute to the project's progress. 
This systematic approach ensures continuous advancement despite our varying schedules and the possibility of unforeseen impediments stemming from other obligations.

2. Furthermore, recognizing the balancing act required due to our diverse commitments, we've adapted the traditional daily SCRUM meetings into a more manageable, weekly format. 
During these weekly SCRUM sessions, we take the opportunity to synthesize our efforts, discuss the work completed, and seamlessly integrate changes through the merging of pertinent Pull Requests (PRs). 
This adjustment from daily to weekly meetings is intended to accommodate our team's unique dynamics while still upholding the spirit of collaboration and rapid iteration central to SCRUM's philosophy.
