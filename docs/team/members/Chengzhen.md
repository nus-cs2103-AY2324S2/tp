## Project: Rainbow Dragon Postmortem
### **Reducing or even doing automated test:**
1. In response to the initial challenge encountered with automated testing, modifications to the AB3 resulted in the incompatibility of several original test cases. Consequently, a decision was made to remove all test cases to prevent interference with the functionality of the GitHub automated testing system.
2. Recognizing the importance of JUnit testing within our team project, efforts were made to selectively restore pertinent test cases. Despite the complexity of this task, we tried to sift through the existing test cases to identify and retain those deemed essential for ensuring the robustness and reliability of our software.
3. Moving forward, the focus shifted to incorporating new JUnit test cases for the additional functionalities introduced in version 1.2 of the Rainbow Dragon. These test cases were meticulously crafted to validate the integrity and performance of the newly implemented features, thereby fortifying the overall quality of our product.
