## Project: vitalconnect

This product is doctors or any healthcare workers that have to keep track of a lot 
of patient information and requires the information at a fast pace, 
thus preferring to have a simple UI such as a CLI instead of a complex GUI, 
with the added benefit of having typed user commands for an even faster retrieval of information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### **New Feature**: 

1. __Create an appointment__

* What it does: allows the user to create an appointment for a patient with the time and date.
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it is the fundamental functions for the project.
* Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

2. __Delete an appointment__

* What it does: allows the user to delete an appointment by specifying the appointment index and the patient's name.
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it is the fundamental functions for the project.
* Credits:


3. __List appointments__

* What it does: allows the user to list out all the upcoming appointments that ordering by time.
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it is the fundamental functions for the project.
* Credits:
