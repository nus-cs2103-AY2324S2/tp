### Project: PoochPlanner

PoochPlanner is a desktop application to track details of various groups (vendors, staff) that dog cafe owners have to regularly interact with. The app is optimised for use using Command Line Interface (CLI) while still encompassing a user-friend Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to give help to users regarding commands.
    * What it does: Returns the user the correct command format for specific commands or all commands.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial for first time users who are unfamiliar to the commands.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is affected by existing commands and must be updated to accomodate to new commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the feature `help` [\#17]())
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added target user profile, value proposition, and user stories [\#19]())
