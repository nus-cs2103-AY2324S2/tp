### Project: LookMeUp

LookMeUp is a desktop address book application targeted for NUS students who stay on campus.
Given how students who stay on campus find themselves in many different committees and interest groups, LookMeUp seeks to provide features that allows them to compartmentalise their contacts and access various groups easily.
LookMeUp also keeps track of the location and details of upcoming meetings specific to each contact, knowing when and who to make calls with.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
