### Project: PoochPlanner

PoochPlanner is a desktop application to track details of various groups (vendors, staff) that dog cafe owners have to regularly interact with. The app is optimised for use using Command Line Interface (CLI) while still encompassing a user-friend Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a certain contact, one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the address book can become too long and cluttered over time. Given the nature of the target users' business, contact turnover rate is expected to be very high and thus deleting unused contacts proves to be useful.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the feature `delete` [\#29]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added use cases for PoochPlanner [\#30]()
