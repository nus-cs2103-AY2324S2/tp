### Project: AronaPro

AronaPro is a desktop application designed for tech-savvy university Computer Science teaching assistants,
enabling them to enjoy an organised and vibrant approach to query, and manage an array of students and professorsâ€™
contacts via the Command Line Interface (CLI).

My contributions to the project are listed below
* **Modify delete feature**: Edited to allow the deletion of an existing contact by NusId. (Pull request #63) 
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete an existing contact via the NusId instead of the index of contact.
    * Justification: This allows user to delete their student quickly with their NusId rather than having to find the index.

* **Modify edit feature**: Edited to allow the edit of an existing contact in terms of name, phone, email, group and tag. (Pull request #73)
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit the name, phone, email, group and tag of an existing contact.
  * Justification: This gives users more flexibility to change their contact information.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed milestone `v1.1` deliverables on GitHub
    * Managed milestone `v1.2` deliverables on GitHub
    * Contributed issues 
    * Reviewed and merged PRs

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()

    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
