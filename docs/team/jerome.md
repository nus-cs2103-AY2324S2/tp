### Project: FinCliq

FinCliq is a desktop client and meeting tracker application optimised for CLI users.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete meetings. ([\#10](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-1/tp/issues/10))
    * What it does: allows the user to delete meetings that a client has.
    * Justification: This feature is essential to allow financial advisors to manage their client's meetings.
    * Credits: This feature was implemented with reference to AddressBook's delete feature, but
      it was a non-trivial task to adapt it to our application's context.
