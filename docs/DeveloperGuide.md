### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add command

This section describes how the `add` commands work which will serve as a basic understanding of how commands are implemented.  

**AddressBookParser** : [`AddressBookParser`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java)
**AddCommandParser** : [`AddCommandParser.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java)
**AddCommand** : [`AddCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java)

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("add --name=Name --phone=2103 --email=hello@Test --addr=Address --tags=hello --tags=Hi")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/AddSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>
Note: `[ARGS]` refer to the arguments of the add command that have been parsed. It have been shortened for brevity

How an `add` command is executed.
1. When Logic is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser`.
   object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command `AddCommandParser`).
   and uses it to parse the arguments passed to the command.
2. `AddCommand` will check that the fields; `name`, `phone`, `email`, and `address`.
   The prefixes for these options are defined in [CliSyntax.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CliSyntax.java).
    1. Parsing of the arguments is done by [`ArgumentTokenizer.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ArgumentTokenizer.java) (not shown here).
    2. This returns a [`ArgumentMultiMap`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/fd570551588e8c9cf372ca6bc87d3c3e5e01b40a/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ArgumentMultimap.java#L20) which supports further operations.  
3. If any of the required prefixes are missing, it will throw a [ParseException](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/exceptions/ParseException.java#L8), which will print a message indicating the correct usage and missing fields, if any.
4. It will then create the [`Client`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/client/Client.java) to represent the Client to be created.
5. The `Client` is used as an argument to create an [`AddCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java).
6. The `AddCommand` is returned by the parser which is passed on by `AddressBookParser` which passes it to [`LogicManager`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/LogicManager.java).
7. `LogicManager` calls the [`execute` method](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java#L52) of `AddCommand` with its model object as a parameter.
8. `AddCommand` returns a [`CommandResult`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CommandResult.java).
9. LogicManager will call `getAddressBook` of `Model` and then use it as an argument to call `saveAddressBook` of its `storage` variable.

### View command

This section describes how the `view` command works and is implemented.

The Object, Sequence and Activity UML diagrams belows shows the objects created as well as their interactions (e.g. method calls) when the `view` command is activated.

#### Class Diagram

<img src="images/ViewClassDiagram.png" width="850"/>

#### Object Diagram

<img src="images/ViewObjectDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Activity Diagram

<img src="images/ViewActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How a `view` command is executed.
1. User Input Parsing
   1. When the user enters a command, it is first parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
   2. The `parseCommand(String userInput)` method in `AddressBookParser` splits the user input into the command word and arguments using a regular expression.
   3. If the command word matches "view", the parsing is delegated to the `ViewCommandParser`.
2. View Command Parsing:
   1. The `ViewCommandParser` expects the arguments to contain an index, which represents the position of the item to view in the list.
   2. The `parse(String args)` method in `ViewCommandParser` parses the index from the arguments using `ParserUtil.parseIndex(args)`.
3. Command Execution
   1. Once the index is parsed successfully, a new `ViewCommand` object is created with the parsed index.
   2. The `ViewCommand` Object is returned to the `AddressBookParser` and then to the `LogicManager`.
   3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and generates a `CommandResult`.
4. `MainWindow` creates a `CommandBox` with the resulting command output, allowing the user to view a contact's information.

### Delete command

This section describes how the `delete` command works and is implemented.

The Sequence and Activity UML diagrams belows shows the objects created as well as their interactions (e.g. method calls) when the `delete` command is activated.

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Activity Diagram

<img src="images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How a `delete` command is executed.
1. User Input Parsing
   1. When the user enters a command, it is first parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
   2. The `parseCommand(String userInput)` method in `AddressBookParser` splits the user input into the command word and arguments using a regular expression.
   3. If the command word matches "del", the parsing is delegated to the `DeleteCommandParser`.
2. Delete Command Parsing:
   1. The `DeleteCommandParser` expects the arguments to contain an index, which represents the position of the client to delete in the list.
   2. The `parse(String args)` method in `DeleteCommandParser` parses the index from the arguments using `ParserUtil.parseIndex(args)`.
3. Command Execution
   1. Once the index is parsed successfully, a new `DeleteCommand` object is created with the parsed index.
   2. The `DeleteCommand` Object is returned to the `AddressBookParser` and then to the `LogicManager`.
   3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and generates a `CommandResult`.
4. `MainWindow` creates a `CommandBox` with the resulting command output, deleting the client at the specified index from the Address Book.

### Find-Tag Command

This section describes how the `find-Tag` command works and is implemented.

The Sequence and Activity UML diagrams belows shows the objects created as well as their interactions (e.g. method calls) when the `find-Tag` command is activated.

### Class Diagram

<img src="images/FindTagClassDiagram.png" width="850"/>

### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/FindTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="550"/>

### Activity Diagram

<img src="images/FindTagActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How a `find-tag` command is executed.
1. The User inputs a command in the format of "find-tag [TAG]" to find clients by tag.
   1. `LogicManager` receives the user command and parses the command to the `AddressBookParser`.
   2. `AddressBookParser` parses this command to the `FindTagCommandParser`.
   3. `FindTagCommandParser` creates a new instance of `FindTagCommand` using the tag as a predicate.

<img src="images/FindTagState1.png" width="650"/>

2. `FindTagCommand` instance is returned to the `LogicManager`.
   1. `LogicManager` calls the execute() method of the `FindTagCommand` instance.
   2. A `CommandResult` is generated and returned to `MainWindow`.
3. `MainWindow` creates a `CommandBox` with the resulting command output, listing our all clients with the specified tag.

<img src="images/FindTagState2.png" width="850"/>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
