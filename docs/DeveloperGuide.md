## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePatient S1234567A`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deletePatient S1234567A")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete S1234567A` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePatientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePatientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePatientCommandParser`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
2. 
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeletePatientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Patient` and `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePatientList` and `AppointmentList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Patient` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Appointment for a Patient

#### Implementation

The implementation of `AddApptCommand` is supported by creation of the `Appointment` class and its related classes.
Details captured in an `Appointment` class include: 
* NRIC
* Date
* TimePeriod (composed of start and end time)
* Appointment Type
* [Optional] Note

The management of all appointments is achieved through the `AppointmentList` class stored in the `AddressBook`, 
similar to the `UniquePatientList`. `AppointmentList` supports adding, editing and deleting of appointments to the list. 
The operation `AppointmentList#add(Appointment)` checks if the incoming appointment already exists in the list, preventing 
duplicates from occurring. Since an `Appointment` can only exist in the `AppointmentList` if a `Patient` with the
corresponding NRIC exists in the `AddressBook`, this will be checked in the execution of the `AddApptCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add appointment mechanism works.

1. The user executes `addAppt i/ S9922758A d/ 2024-03-27 from/ 00:00 to/ 00:30 t/ Medical Check-up note/`, 
attempting to create an appointment for a patient with NRIC: S9922758A on 27 Mar 2024 from 12am to 1230am. 
2. `AddApptCommand` calls `Model#hasPatientWithNric(Nric)` to check if the given NRIC belongs to an individual
    in the system. If yes, continue. Else throw a `CommandException`.
3. `AddApptCommand` calls `Model#hasAppointment(Appointment)` to check if an equivalent appointment exists
    in the system. If no, continue. Else throw a `CommandException`.
4. `AddApptCommand` calls `Model#addAppointment(Appointment) to add the appointment to the `AddressBook`.
5. We are done.

The following sequence diagram shows how an addAppt operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddApptSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddApptSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes addApptCommand.

<puml src="diagrams/AddApptActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddApptActivityDiagram" />


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to match an `Appointment` to a `Patient`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store only the NRIC of the `Patient` in `Appointment`.
    * Pros: Data integrity since NRIC is the "primary key" of `Patient` and will not change, Space efficient
    * Cons: May have performance issues as we need to search the whole list to get other details of the `Person`

* **Alternative 2:** Store `Patient` in `Appointment`
    * Pros: Time efficient as we have access to all details of the `Patient` from `Appointment`
    * Cons: Space inefficient, we double store `Patient`. We need to ensure `Patient` in `UniquePatientList` and `Patient` in
        each `Appointment` is always consistent which can be tricky.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `deletePatient S1234567A` command to delete the patient with corresponding NRIC S1234567A in the address book. The `deletePatient` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `deletePatient S1234567A` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addPatient n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletePatient`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Find Appointment feature

#### Implementation

The Find Appointment feature will involve parsing user input, executing search queries based on specified criteria, and presenting the results to the user.

The implementation will include the following key components:

1. **Parsing User Input**: The application will parse user input to extract search criteria such as NRIC, date, or time (any combination of the three).
2. **Executing Search Queries**: The application will search through the list of appointments stored in the database and identify appointments that match the specified criteria.
3. **Presenting Search Results**: The matched appointments will be presented to the user in a clear and organized manner, displaying relevant details such as appointment time, date, and associated patient information.

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. **Context**: User wants to find an appointment with a specific NRIC, date, and start time.
2. **User Input**: The user enters the command `findAppt i/S1234567A d/2024-03-23 from/11:00`.

<puml src="diagrams/FindApptSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindApptSeqDiag" />

3. **Parsing**: The application parses the user input and extracts the NRIC (`S1234567A`), date (`2024-03-23`), and start time (`11:00`) criteria for the search.
4. **Search Execution**: The application searches through the list of appointments and identifies appointments that match the specified NRIC, date, and start time criteria.
5. **Presentation**: The matched appointments are presented to the user, displaying relevant details such as appointment time, date, and associated patient information.
6. **User Interaction**: The user can view the search results and perform additional actions such as viewing detailed information about specific appointments or modifying appointments as needed.
   
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/FindApptActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindApptActivityDiagram" width="250" />

#### Design Considerations

##### User Experience
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback to the user during the search process to indicate progress and inform them of any issues encountered.
- **Support for Multiple Criteria**: Allow users to specify multiple search criteria (e.g., any combination of NRIC, date, start time) to enable more precise searches.

##### Error Handling
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle cases where users provide invalid or incomplete search criteria.
- **No Matching Results**: Handle scenarios where no appointments match the specified criteria gracefully, providing informative feedback to the user.
