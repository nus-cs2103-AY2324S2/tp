## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Appointment
#### Implementation
##### Appointment Classes
Appointment is a new feature that was added to the app. It is a new entity that is related to a `Patient`. An `Appointment` object has the following attributes:
- Appointment ID
- Appointment Date Time
- Patient ID
- Attended Status
- Appointment Description

Appointment ID is a unique identifier for each appointment. It is generated by the system when a new appointment is created.

The Appointment Date Time is the date and time of the appointment.

The Patient ID is the unique identifier of the patient that the appointment is related to.

The Attended Status is a boolean value that indicates whether the patient has attended the appointment.

The Appointment Description is a String that describes the appointment.

##### Appointment Storage
Appointment are stored in the `Model` component as `AppointmentList` which contains `UniqueAppointmentList` object that is parallel similar to `PatientList` storing `UniquePatientList`. 
The `Model` component provides methods to add, delete, and retrieve appointments from `AppointmentList`

![Appointment Storage](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

Appointment List are saved under a separate file `appointments.json` in the data folder, apart from the `patients.json` file that stores the `patientList` data.


#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Patient ID**
- In any system that manages individual records, it is critical to ensure that we are able to distinguish between entities (which are patients) in our case.


- **Alternative 1: Using Integer ID as the primary key (Current Approach)**
  - We needed some method to ensure that the patient was unique. The primary solution implemented involves a running integer identifier - and is saved together with each patient. The identifier serves as the primary key for the patient object, similar to how a unique ID in a database ensure each record's uniqueness.
  - This was different to how the AB3 application was originally designed - where the ID followed the natural ordering of the elements in the list.
  - Pros
    - Extremely user-friendly for counsellor as ID is never changed. 
      - Potentially patient can even be issued a member card starting that patient ID.
  - Cons
    - Difficult to implement.
    - There will be "holes" in the sequential ID when records are deleted.

- **Alternative 2: Using Name as the primary key**
  - This approach was quickly deemed unsuitable due to the high probability of name duplication. While names are an important identifier, there is a great risk of collision (i.e. Jack Tan vs Jack Tan Ah Kou). While this method is sufficient for a non-mission critical address book, our CogniCare application must try to reduce the likeliness of errors occurring.
  - Pros
    - Extremely user friendly
  - Cons
    - Commands will be extremely long; and difficult to type.
    - Counsellor will need to remember exactly how the full name is spelt.
    - May select the wrong patient (i.e. Jack Tan vs Jack Tan Ah Kou).
    
- **Alternative 3: Using Natural Ordering of the names in CogniCare application (AB3 approach)**
  - As we initially strived for a design where the patientId was used like a Foreign Key in the Appointments object, the ID changing would mean that the data integrity for Appointments class would be compromised
  - Pros
    - Easy to implement
  - Cons
    - Data Integrity of Appointments will be compromised
    - Every time a patient is deleted, the subsequent IDs will be coalesced.


**Aspect: Search query with AND constraint**
In enhancing the search functionality within CogniCare, the implementation of an AND constraint for search queries was paramount. This feature allows counsellors to refine search criteria, leading to more precise and relevant search results. For example, counsellors can search for a patient using a combination of (partial name AND partial phone number AND partial email address). Only parameter is required, the others are optional.

This enhancement was driven for the need of:
1. Improved Search Accuracy: By allowing multiple criteria to be specified, counsellors can narrow down search results to the most relevant patients (as the SoC cohort is quite large).
2. Efficiency: Enables quicker access to patient records by reducing the time spent sifting through irrelevant patient information.

**Single Criterion Search (AB3 Approach)**: The original AB3 approach of allowing search based on a single criterion was found to be too limiting for the different needs of patient management in CogniCare.

**Search Query with OR Constraint:** While also considered, this approach was determined to potentially yield too broad of a search result, undermining the efficiency desired in retrieving patient record.

**Aspect: Appointment ID**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate auto-increasing fixed appointment ID when creating a new appointment. Fail commands that attempt to set the appointment ID still increase the appointment ID.
  - Pros: 
    - Easier to implement.
    - This is the implementation that take inspires from DBMS auto-increment.
    - Consistency in appointment ID.
    - Easier to store as a separate file for appointments storage.
  - Cons: Confusion for users who expect appointment ID to increase one by one.
  - Mitigation: Ensure that the appointment ID is unique.
  
- **Alternative 2 (AB3 choice):** No fixed appointment ID. AppointmentID is relative to the Appointment view.
  - Pros: More flexible for users.
  - Cons: More complex to implement. May lead to inconsistencies between appointments.

**Aspect: Where to store appointments locally**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store appointments in a separate file.
  - Pros: Easier to manage appointments separately from patients.
  - Cons: 
    - More complex to manage two separate files.
    - Time complexity to carry out command with appointments as it has to read the whole list of appointments.
  - Risks: May lead to inconsistencies between the two files in regard to ids.
  - Mitigation: Ensure that both files are updated together.
  
- **Alternative 2:** Store appointments as a field in the `Patient` class. Hence, all appointments data will be stored in the same file as the `patientList`.
  - Pros: Easier to manage a single file.
  - Cons: 
    - May lead to a more complex data structure.
    - Delete a patient will cascade delete all appointments.
  - Risks: May lead to performance issues when reading/writing data.
  - Mitigation: Optimize the data structure for reading/writing data.

**Aspect: How to store appointments**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store appointments as a `AppointmentList` in `Model`.
  - Pros: 
    - Easier to design since it is similar to `patientList` implementation.
    - If we want to add more Object for Model, this will be the default implementation
  - Cons:
    - Adding extra layer of OOP abstraction.
    - May lead to performance issues when reading/writing data (more prone to crashing issues).

- **Alternative 2:** Store appointments as a list of `Appointment` objects in `patientList`.
  - Pros: Easier to manage appointments as a list.
  - Cons: 
    - Reduce in OOP-ness of the code
    - Hard to scale up, as need to change the whole code base.
    
=======
### Command History

Command history is a feature that aims to improve the user experience for experienced users by allowing them to quickly
navigate through their history of commands to make minor changes. Many features were inspired from macOS's Bash shell

**Implementation**
An array list was used to store the history of commands and an index to indicate which command is the history currently 
at. 
- The list is initialised to have an empty string as the initial element
- The current command index defaults to 0

There are a few methods used to interact with the command history
1. getCurrentCommand()
   1. Gets the command at the current command index
2. undo()
   1. Decrements the current command index by 1
   2. If the current command index is already 0, it will play a Boop sound to indicate that there is 
are no more commands left to undo
3. redo()
   1. Increments the current command index by 1

Below shows expected behaviour of the command history from a series of actions. 
- blue underline - denotes where the command index
is pointing at.
- initial - the initial state of the command history
- exec - when any command is executed
- undo - decrements the index
- redo - increments the index

![](images/command-history/command-history-illustration.jpeg)

**Rationale for implementation**
There are a few key features that this module aims to implement
1. Improved user experience for experienced users
   1. Allow users to modify their past commands in a predictable way
   2. Allow users to easily compare past commands in case of mistakes by pressing up and down
2. Mimicking bash shell features
   1. Playing a sound to indicate that there are no more commands left to undo
   2. Empty the input box when there are no more commands left to redo
3. Default empty string in list
   1. This aims to model what the command history actually looks like. By doing this, this makes the logic much more straightforward as we don't need to constantly check to return empty string or not

**Alternatives considered**
1. 2 stacks, one undo and one redo were used at first. However, this had the drawback of not being able to remember commands after undoing and writing a new command.
2. undo() and redo() both returned the previous and next command respectively - This had a flaw in which the logic of handling the command index became unnecessarily complex as we had to worry about when we incremented/decremented an index. This also made it harder to test the functionality

=======
### Add Appointment Feature

The add appointment feature allows users to create a new appointment and insert them into the application.

**Implementation**
An observable list was used to store the list of appointments.
- The list is initialised as an empty list of type appointments in the beginning.

There are a few methods used to interact with the add appointment command.
1. AddAppointmentCommand
   1. Defines add appointment command key word and other error messages.
   2. Validates the results of the AddAppointmentCommandParser#parse()
2. AddAppointmentCommandParser#parse()
   1. Parses the add appointment commands, ensuring that all required parameters are present.
   2. Returns AddAppointmentCommand

**Rationale for implementation**
There are a few key features that this module aims to implement
1. Allow users to add new appointments to keep track of all past and upcoming appointments.

**Alternatives considered**
1. Using an array list instead of an observable list. However, the GUI was not able to accurately reflect the new appointment list when new appointments were added.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />
a

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
