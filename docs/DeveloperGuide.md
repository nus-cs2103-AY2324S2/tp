## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add functon 
The new add function allows user to add new contacts to the address book. <br>
<br> 
Users can now choose to add tags to the contact upon addition of new contacts by running the command as `add n/name t/tag`. <br>
<br>
Users can also add multiple tags to a person upon addition of a new contact by running `add n/name t/tag1 t/tag2`<br>
<br> 
Users can also assign new contact categories upon addition by running `add n/name t/tag c/cat d/description`, where `cat` is the category associated 
with the new contact and `description` is the category information that is assigned to the new contact. <br>
<br> 
Users can also assign multiple categorical information to the new contact added by running `add n/name t/tag c/cat1, cat2, cat3 d/d1, d2, d3`, 
where `cat1` corresponds to `d1` and `cat2` corresponds to `d2` and so on. Users can definitely add more than 3 categories with descriptions in one addition. 
<br> 
<br> 
The sequence diagram below illustrates how the add function can be used. 
<puml src="docs/diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Add Command Sequence Diagram" />

### AddCategory function
The new addCategory function allows user to be able to add any category to a person <br>
he sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("edit 1 c/Clan d/rainbow")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/AddCategorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addCategory 1 c/class d/warrior` Command" />

#### 1. How the feature is implemented
Upon specification of a string for category and description, an entry object is created , which is then added to the person
specified by the index given by the user. If a duplicate category or invalid index is provided, an error will be thrown

#### 2. Why it is implemented that way.
Entry requiring only two Strings meant that the type of entries that can be created by the user is limitless, suitable for an application that inputs potential characteristics
from games. However, due to deleteCategory requiring the category name, it was decided that categories be unique per person. It was required that index be specified as Name can be non unique in addressbook.

#### 3. Alternatives considered.
Given our initial vision of a customisable field option for the addressbook persons, there wasnt really much of an alternative as gaming contacts can vary quite widely. It would not make sense to have compulsory fields 
except for name since many things like phone, address and email may be unknown to the user for online or gaming contacts otherwise. This way, things like gaming information can be captured with no restrictions.

### Edit function
The new edit function allows user to be able to edit any category based they want.<br>
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("edit 1 c/Clan d/rainbow")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit 1 c/Clan d/rainbow` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### 1. How the feature is implemented
The edit feature in the address book application is implemented through the `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser` classes.
The `EditCommand` class handles the logic of editing a person's details, such as category, description, and tags.
It uses an inner class, `EditPersonDescriptor`, to hold the values to be edited, allowing partial updates to a person's information.
The execute method in `EditCommand` performs the actual update, ensuring that the edited person does not duplicate existing entries.
The `EditCommandParser` class parses user input into an `EditCommand` object. It validates the input and extracts the necessary information
(like index, category, description, and tags) to create an `EditPersonDescriptor`, which is then used to instantiate an `EditCommand`.
Below is the method used to instantiate the `EditPersonDescriptor` used to "remember" what category and description is being changed.
```
editPersonDescriptor.set(category, ParserUtil.parse(category, category));
editPersonDescriptor.setCategory(category);
```
Additionally, in the `EditCommand` class, the method:
```
Person editedPerson = createEditedPerson(personToEdit, editPersonDescriptor);
```
Creates this `EditPersonDescriptor` for it to edit the necessary code implemented by the user.

#### 2. Why it is implemented that way.
This implementation segregates the parsing of user input from the execution logic, adhering to the single responsibility principle
and making the code more maintainable and testable. The `EditCommand` class focuses solely on the business logic of editing a person's details,
while the `EditCommandParser` deals with interpreting the user's input. This separation allows for clearer structure and easier debugging,
as each class has a distinct responsibility. The use of `EditPersonDescriptor` as a way to encapsulate the editable attributes of a person enables a
flexible design where only specified fields can be updated, enhancing the user experience by allowing partial edits.

#### 3. Alternatives considered.
Alternatives that might have been considered include implementing the parsing logic directly within the `EditCommand class`, which would reduce the number
of classes and potentially simplify the command's initiation process. However, this approach could lead to a more complex `EditCommand` class, making it
harder to manage and maintain. Another alternative could be the use of reflection to dynamically update fields in the `Person` class based on input,
which would make adding new fields easier. However, this could increase complexity and decrease code readability and security due to the dynamic nature of reflection.
Additionally, the `EditPersonDescriptor` could be completely remove as the implementation of the `Entry` class would allow the edit of categories directly.


### Find function

The Find Command feature within the provided address book application is structured to enable users to search for persons based on specified criteria.

#### Implementation

The feature is implemented through several interconnected components:

1. **FindCommand Class**: This is the core of the feature, encapsulating the logic to find and list all persons whose fields match the specified criteria. It leverages a `PersonFieldsContainKeywordPredicate` to filter matching persons. Upon execution, it updates the model's filtered person list to reflect the search results.

2. **PersonFieldsContainKeywordPredicate Class**: Represents the criteria used to filter persons. It checks if any of the person's fields match the specified keywords in their categories, descriptions, or tags. This flexibility allows for a more nuanced search capability.

3. **FindCommandParser Class**: Parses the user input into a usable format for the `FindCommand`. It ensures the input adheres to the expected format, extracting relevant information to create a `PersonFieldsContainKeywordPredicate`.

4. **Model Interface**: Defines the API that the `FindCommand` interacts with, specifically the `updateFilteredPersonList` method that updates the list of displayed persons based on the predicate.

#### Rationale

The design choices made in implementing the Find Command are based on several considerations:

- **Modularity and Single Responsibility**: Each class has a clear and distinct role. `FindCommand` handles command execution, `PersonFieldsContainKeywordPredicate` defines the search criteria, and `FindCommandParser` processes user input. This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable and extendable.

- **Flexibility in Search Criteria**: By using a predicate that can filter based on categories, descriptions, and tags, the implementation provides a versatile search functionality. This approach caters to various user needs, allowing for more detailed queries.

- **User-Friendly Command Syntax**: The command syntax is designed to be intuitive, with clear prefixes indicating the type of criteria (category, description, tag). This choice aims to enhance usability, making it easier for users to construct their search queries.

- **Enables Batch Processing**: Specifying multiple `c/<category> d/<description>` allows the user to look for multiple people who satisfy the at least one of the `c/ d/`.

- **Tags**: Finding with tags also allows batch processing, which enhances the users' experience in searching for people who belong to different tags.

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **Regular Expression Searches**: Implementing search functionality that allows for regular expression patterns could provide even more flexibility. However, this might increase the complexity of the user interface and require users to have knowledge of regular expressions.

2. **Separate Commands for Different Criteria**: Creating separate commands for searching by category, description, and tag could simplify the implementation. However, this approach was likely rejected because it would complicate the user experience, requiring users to remember and choose from multiple commands based on their search needs.

In conclusion, the Find Command is implemented with a focus on flexibility, usability, and maintainability, balancing advanced search capabilities with ease of use for the end user. The chosen implementation provides a solid foundation that can be easily extended or modified as the application evolves.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>
=======
### DeleteCategory function

The command `deleteCategory INDEX c/CATEGORY` allows users to delete the `CATEGORY` of a person at the specified `INDEX`.
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteCategory 1 c/Clan")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCategorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteCategory 1 c/Clan` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCategoryCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

The feature of deleting category is implemented by the `DeleteCategoryCommand` and `DeleteCategoryCommandParser` classes.
The `DeleteCategoryCommand` class handles the logic of deleting one of user's category.
The execute class in `DeleteCategoryCommand` class checks if the input category is existing.
The `DeleteCategoryCommandParser` class parses user input into an `DeleteCategoryCommand` object. It validates the input and extracts the necessary information to instantiate an `DeleteCategoryCommand`.
If the format of command is correct, the `DeleteCategory` object will try to call the `deleteEntry` method from `Parser` class to delete the corresponding category.
If the format of command is wrong or the category does not exist, the `DeleteCategoryCommand` or `DeleteCategoryCommandParser` class will throw an exception.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There are some caveat for `deleteCategory` command:
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* The category **must exist**.
