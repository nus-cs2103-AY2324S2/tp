# Avengers Assemble v1.2 Release Notes

> Note: There might be some issues importing outside of IDEs for Mac users due to privacy setting issues. We recommend users testing on Mac to use the IDE to run the .jar file and import the csv file.

### 3. Find Feature
Avengers Assemble now supports finding contacts by their various details, and not just their names!

1. Simply type `find` to find a contact by their details, followed by the field you want to search up. For example, the screenshot below shows finding contacts with an address containing `30`.

2. The result will show all contacts with an address containing `30`.

Avengers Assemble also supports copying the emails of any specific group of contacts in the list into your clipboard!

1. Use the `find` command to search for the people whose emails you would like to copy.
2. Type `copy` to copy all the emails of currently displayed contacts into your clipboard.

### 5. New Fields Added
To further support head TAs keeping track of the various reflections and studios happening in the ever hectic CS1101S, Avengers Assemble now supports adding the reflection `r/` and studio `s/` fields to contacts!

### 6. Bug Fixes
Previously, the existing codebase checked for duplicate contacts by their name. However, this was not sufficient as there could be multiple contacts with the same name which is especially likely for a large course like CS1101S. This has been fixed by checking for the duplicates by their email.
