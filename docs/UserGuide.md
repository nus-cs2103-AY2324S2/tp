Pedagogue Pages is a **desktop app for teachers of young children to manage class rosters, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Pedagogue Pages holds many advantages over traditional rostering methods, such as Excel and physical methods due to it being tailored for teachers of young children.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `pedagoguepages.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.2).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Pedagogue Pages.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar pedagoguepages.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432, 91233322 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 id/00007 t/Friends t/Owes Money` : Adds a student named `John Doe` with `Student ID` 00007 to Pedagogue Pages.

   * `delete 00003` : Deletes the student with `Student ID` 00003 from the list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Pedagogue Pages will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Pedagogue Pages to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Pedagogue Pages home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
