# ClinicMate User Guide

Welcome to ClinicMate, your efficient companion for managing contacts in a clinic! This user guide is designed to help you navigate ClinicMate effortlessly, whether you're a seasoned user or just getting started.

ClinicMate is a **desktop** app for managing contacts in a clinic, optimized for use via a  **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClinicMate can manage your patients' contact faster than traditional GUI apps.

Our target audience includes healthcare professionals and clinic staff who need a streamlined way to manage patient contacts. We assume that users have basic computer literacy and are familiar with using desktop applications.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. Open Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for MacOS and Linux) on your desktop.
2. Run the command `java -version` to check if you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.
* Assuming that you have Java installed in your computer,
  * If you have a Windows, in this case the Java version is 19.0.2.
       ![javaWindows](images/javaWindows.png)
  * If you have a Mac,  in this case the Java version is 11.0.19.
     ![javaMac](images/javaMac.png)
3. If you do not have Java 11 or above installed in your computer, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Setting up
1. Download the latest `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp/releases/latest)
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClinicMate.
   * e.g. if you want to use the `Documents` folder as the _home folder_ for your ClinicMate, create a new folder named `clinicmate` in the `Documents` folder.
   * You can then copy the `.jar` file to a folder named `clinicmate` in your `Documents` folder.
   

### Running the application
1. Open Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for MacOS and Linux) on your desktop.
2. Run the `cd` command into the folder you put the jar file in.
   * `cd` is the command to change directory.
   * e.g. `cd Documents/clinicmate`
3. Run the `java -jar clinicmate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/updatedUI.png)

4. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/88888888 e/johndoe@mail.com i/T0123456A ag/12 s/Male a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ClinicMate.

   * `delete T0123456A` : Deletes the contact with the IC 'T0123456A' shown in the current list.

   * `find T0123456A` : Find the contact with the IC 'T0123456A' shown in the current list.

   * `addnote T0123456A n/Patient has diabetes` : Add a note: 'Patient has diabetes' for the contact with the IC 'T0123456A' as shown in current list.
   
   * `addnote T0123456A n/Patient has diabetes -replace` : Replace the note of the contact with the IC 'T0123456A' with 'Patient has diabetes'.
   
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

5. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME i/IC_NUMBER`, `i/IC_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClinicMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClinicMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CLinicMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
