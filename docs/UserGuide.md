# Quick start

Let's get started with ClientCare. This section will help you get familiar with how ClientCare works, from installation to using ClientCare.



## Installation instructions


Don't have ClientCare installed on your computer yet? Check out our step-by-step installation instructions to
download ClientCare.

1. ClientCare is written in the programming language Java, so you'll need **Java 11 or above** installed in your computer to run ClientCare.
    1. Not sure if you have a compatible Java version installed on your computer?
       Windows or macOS users might find [this guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/check-java-verison) useful.
    2. Don't have a compatible Java version installed? Fret not, Java is free to install! Complete installation
       instructions can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

## Getting familiar with ClientCare
Now that we got ClientCare up and running, let's get you familiar with its display.
You will learn how the different parts of ClientCare look and work in this section.

#### ClientCare's Display Components

ClientCare has **6** components in its GUI. Different commands affect parts of the Display.
You can refer to the [Quick Tutorial](#quick-tutorial) to see how the different parts of the display change when entering commands!

![Display](images/ug/GUI%20v1.2%20Graphic.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Text Commands Introduction
ClientCare works through text commands. Instead of clicking buttons, you tell ClientCare what to do by typing!

These commands must be formatted in a specific way or ClientCare will not understand what you are saying.
Let's learn the language that ClientCare speaks in.

<br>

### ClientCare Commands
A ClientCare command has the following parts:

![Command Structure](images/ug/commandStructure.jpg =450x)

##### 1) Command Keyword
This keyword tells ClientCare what you want to do. If you want to add a new client, then `add` will be the keyword.
All commands must start with a keyword.

##### 2) Index
Some commands may involve an index, indicated in command formats as `INDEX`. This is simply a number which is assigned to a particular Client.
For example, the first client in the list will have the index `1`.

The index can take on values from 1 to the number of clients shown in the Client List. It will never be **0 or a negative number**.

##### 3) Command Fields
Some commands have fields associated with them. For example, when you are adding a client, you need to add his name too.
His name will be considered a field, similarly for Date of Birth, Address etc.

Here are some things to take note of when using them!
* Fields often have a prefix in front of them. For example, name has `n/` and date has `d/`. The command format will show what field a prefix is referring to in uppercase, like `n/NAME`, in case you forget!
* Some fields are even optional, and they'll be shown with square brackets: `[a/ADDRESS]`.
* Fields that have a trailing ellipsis behind them like `[t/TAG]...`, meaning you can use multiple of them, so you can have both `t/friend t/drives` in one command.
* Not all commands have fields! For example, when clearing your client list, a simple command keyword of `clear` will do! There is no need to have a parameter such as `clear 1` or `clear 2`.

The full list of commands and their formats can be found under the [Features](#features) section.
Alternatively, [Command Summary](#command-summary) has all of them under one page for a quick reference.

<box type="warning" theme="danger" icon=":warning:">

**CAUTION**: If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as the command format may be copied over incorrectly.
</box>

## Quick Tutorial
Excited to play around with ClientCare?
Let’s run you through some simple commands to get you warmed up before you dive right into ClientCare’s full feature list!

<box type="info">

**Note:** Your ClientCare may look different upon starting up. This is because the client data stored within the app may be different.

</box>

Let's boot up ClientCare and get started!

1. Suppose we just met a new client! Let's add James Wee to our client list and his following details:
  * Phone Number: 98765432
  * Email: james@hotmail.com
  * Address: East Coast Blk 112
  * Birthday: 25 May 1998
  * Priority: VIP

Type the following into the Command Input:

`add n/James Wee c/98765432 e/james@hotmail.com a/East Coat Blk 112 d/1998-05-25 p/vip`

![addclient](images/ug/addclient.png =600x)


2. We have now added James Wee to our Client List! ClientCare shows a success message in the Feedback Display too.



![success_add](images/ug/success_add.png =600x)



3. Now let's schedule an appointment with James Wee 7 days from now. From the Client List, James has an index of `7`.
When this guide was released, today was 27 March 2024. Hence, let's set the appointment at 3 April 2024 2pm.
Let's type the following command into the Command Input:


`schedule 7 d/2024-04-03 14:00`

![schedule](images/ug/schedule.png =600x)

<box type="info">

**Note:** Since you cannot schedule an appointment on a date that has passed, do change the date field as needed.

</box>

4. Our schedule with James has been updated in both Client Details and Schedule Display!



![success_schedule](images/ug/success_add.png =600x)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5. Now let's get interesting. What happens if we encounter an error?

ClientCare will show us the error along with the correct command format in the Feedback Display.


![error](images/ug/error.png =600x)

### Saving the data

No manual saving is required!
ClientCare data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<br/>
<br/>

### Editing the data file

ClientCare data is automatically saved as a file `[ClientCare file location]/data/clientcare.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" theme="danger" icon=":warning:">

**CAUTION**: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientCare will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientCare to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

#### Multiple Screens
**When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
