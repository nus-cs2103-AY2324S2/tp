# <span id='feature-gettingStarted'>  Getting Started <span>

## <span id='feature-install'> Installing and Launching TutorsContactsPro <span>

### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, follow the instructions in [Appendix A: Installing Java](#appendix-a-installing-java).

### Step 2: Download 

Download the latest `TutorsContactsPro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

### Step 3: Set up TutorsContactsPro Home Folder

Copy or move the downloaded `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorsContactsPro.

### Step 4: Launch TutorsContactsPro

1. Open a terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, John Doe has his `TutorsContactsPro.jar` file in `/Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro`, so he'll run:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/TutorsContactsPro
    ```

3. Verify that your working directory contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar` by using the `ls` command. You should see `TutorsContactsPro.jar` in the list of files printed. Here's what our John Doe got when running this command.

    ```bash
    JohnDoe@johndoe TutorsContactsPro % ls
    TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```
4. Once your terminal's working directory is the folder that contains `TutorsContactsPro.jar`, run the following command to launch TutorsContactsPro:

    ```bash 
    java -jar TutorsContactsPro.jar
    ```

   After executing this command, a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one below should appear shortly:

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorsContactsPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TutorsContactsPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## <span id='feature-appendix-a-installing-java'> Appendix A: Installing Java <span>

Follow these steps to install Java on your computer:

1. **Download Java 11:**
- Download Java 11 from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) based on your operating system.

2. **Follow the instructions on Oracle's website**
    - Go to the appropriate guide page and follow the instructions based on your operating system to complete the installation.
        - [MacOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
        - [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)
        - [Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-737A84E4-2EFF-4D38-8E60-3E29D1B884B8)

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, open a terminal (on MacOS) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and run the following commands to verify that Java is installed:

  ```
   java -version
  ```
If installed correctly, you should see version information for both Java and the Java Compiler. The message should look something like this:
```
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Now, you're ready to proceed with the launching of TutorsContactsPro. Click [here](#feature-install) to get back to the installation tutorial.
