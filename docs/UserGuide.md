# MatchMate User Guide

Matchmate is a **desktop app to create groups among their friends / acquaintances,
as well as to allow students to find balanced groups with diverse skillsets out of their own contact list.** 
It is optimized for Command Line Interface space(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `matchmate.jar`

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your app.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar matchmate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   
   * `add John Doe -p 87654321 -e johndoe@example.com -s Leadership -s C++`: Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the contact list.

   * `delete #3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add NAME [-p PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `add John Doe -p 8762318` or as `add John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-s SKILL]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-s C++`, `-s C++ -s Python` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**

Instead of supplying a full name to identify an existing contact, you can use the following shortcuts:
- `#1`, `#2`, …, `#n` (where n is the number of contacts currently displayed in the contact list panel) – `#k` references the k-th contact currently displayed in the contact list panel.


- `##` – References the contact currently displayed in the detailed view panel.


- A substring of the name instead of the full name.
    - In the event of multiple matches (the substring appears in multiple contacts), you will receive the following message: `There are x course mates with similar names.
      Retry the command by specifying the index of the contact in the list, example: #1.` and the list of matching contacts will be displayed in the contact list panel.
    - No side effects will be made by the current command.
    - You should retry the command by finding the contact on the list and using the hashtag notation (`#`) to identify the contact.

  Example:
    - You have the following contacts listed in the contact list panel:

      `#1 Benson`

      `#2 Ben`

      Typing `edit Ben` will display a warning message for having multiple matches.
    - Case 1 Edit Benson:
        - Type  `edit Benson ...` or just its substring `edit Bens ...`
        - Alternatively, you can use the alias `edit #1 ...`
    - Case 2 Edit Ben:
        - Type `edit #2 ...` as you must specify its index in the list.

- `edit John Doe -n Joe Schmo`

### Save and load the state of app

Load the saved data when starting the app. Save the state of coursemates and groups every time it is updated via adding or editing. This should run automatically on start and subsequently after a command that alters the state of the app (e.g. add, edit).

### Editing the data file

MatchMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/matchmate.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MatchMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the MatchMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MatchMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
