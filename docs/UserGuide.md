# CodeConnect User Guide
Hello fellow student developers! Welcome to your one-stop shop for managing developers' contacts!

Codeconnect is a **developer-first networking app** for student developers to keep track of and reach out easily to other student developers, so they form teams for hackathons. 

We are **optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CC can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### What can CodeConnect do for you?
- **Add, Edit, Update, Delete** a student developer's contact details
- Record **Tech Stack** and **GitHub Usernames** for each developer
- **Find** developers by their name, tags, or tech stack
- **Email** developers directly from the app
- Manage your hackathon teams by adding your team members to CodeConnect
- **Export** your team details for easy signing up for hackathons

## Features

### Commands

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG] [ts/TECH_STACK]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend ts/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeConnect home folder.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
