## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME ic/NRIC`, `NAME` and `NRIC` are parameters which can be used as `add n/John Doe ic/S1234567D`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `h/HEIGHT w/WEIGHT [t/ALLERGY]` can be used as `h/163 w/50 t/Amoxicillin` or as `h/163 w/50`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Amoxicillin`, `t/insulin t/iodine` etc.
  e.g. `[t/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Amoxicillin`, `t/insulin t/iodine` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `ic/NRIC p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER ic/NRIC` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Clinic will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Clinic to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Clinic home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
