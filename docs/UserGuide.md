Each tier offers different benefits, such as discounts, free items, or exclusive products that can be customised by you. Here is a breakdown of the tiers:

**Bronze Tier**: This is the starting tier for all new members. Members need to accumulate at least 100 points to move to the next tier.
**Silver Tier**: Members who have accumulated 200 points are upgraded to the Silver Tier, which offers more benefits than the Bronze Tier.
**Gold Tier**: Members who have accumulated 500 points are upgraded to the Gold Tier, which offers more benefits than the Silver Tier.
**Platinum Tier**: This is the highest tier, reserved for members who have collected 1000 points. Gold Tier members receive the best benefits, underlining their importance to your bakery.
Points can be accumulated by making purchases and participating in bakery events. Ensure to regularly update member points using the addpoints command to reflect their current balance. Upgrading membership tiers can be done using the updatemembership command once a member reaches the required points threshold.
