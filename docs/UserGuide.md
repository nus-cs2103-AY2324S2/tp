## [2. Getting Started](#table-of-contents)

### [2.1. Installation](#2-getting-started)
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.
    - Download Java 11 from [the official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
1. Download the jar file from [our latest release](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases).
1. Move it to an **Empty** folder.
    > :warning: App data will be stored in sub-folders from where it is launched. While you could run the app from any location, we recommend making a dedicated folder for our app to avoid confusion.

### [2.2.  Launching the App](#2-getting-started)
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.
1. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

### [2.3. Basic Commands](#2-getting-started)

> :bulb: This section covers commands first-time users might need. For the full commands list, refer to the [Features](#features) section.

Let's go over the basic PressPlanner workflow. Say you've just finished interviewing a certain Gill Bates about his company's latest product. You want to save his contact for later and keep track of your article. Let's fire up PressPlanner and get this task out of the way.

1. Selecting the command box at the top of the page, let's first add Gill Bates to our address book.
    - To `add` a contact we need to include the following information separated by their prefixes:
        - Name (`n/`)
        - Phone number (`p/`)
        - Email (`e/`)
        - Address (`a/`)
    - For example: `add n/Gill Bates p/12345678 e/gillbates@sicromoft.com a/Sicromoft HQ`


2. Next let's add that article you just wrote.
    > :bulb: Adding an article uses the `add -a` command, the `-a` standing for article. The `-a` suffix is used for all commands pertaining to articles.
   - To `add -a` an article we need the following information:
           - Title (`T/`)
           - Author (`A/`)
           - Source (`SRC/`)
           - Date (`D/`)
           - Category (`C/`)
           - Status (`S/`)
       - For example: `add -a T/My Article A/Myself SRC/Gill Bates D/2024-03-02T20:00:00 C/New Releases S/DRAFT`

3. Now that that's done, let's say you need to find Gill Bate's number to arrange another interview
    - Typing the command `find Gill Bates` will pull up his contact

4. If you made a mistake or want to see all your contacts again:
    - Typing the command `list` will bring up all your contacts

5. If you want to look up your article:
    - Typing the command `find -a My First Article` will pull up the article

6. If you want to see all your articles again:
    - Typing the command `list -a` will bring them all up

Now that you know the basic workflow, go ahead and try it out for yourself. If you want to learn more commands, use the `help` command in-app or refer to the [features](#3-features) section of this guide.

## [3. Features](#table-of-contents)

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times. If the item is also in square brackets, it can even be used zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## [5. FAQs](#table-of-contents)
### [5.1. Why am I unable to run PressPlanner on my desktop?](#5-faqs)
* Please check that you have downloaded Version 11 Java SDK that suits your computer’s operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
* If you are unsure of whether you have done so, please navigate back to the “Getting Started” Segment of the User Guide to access the link which will bring you to the Java Oracle Website where you can re-download the Version 11 Java SDK for your operating system.

### [5.2. How do I ensure that I have saved all the contacts and articles I have added in this session?](#5-faqs)
* Do not worry about issues regarding the saving of data you have entered into the application, they are saved into files automatically upon the execution of every command which modifies or adds new data.

### [5.3. Why were all my previous data for contacts (and / or) articles from previous sessions deleted and replaced by the default template data?](#5-faqs)
* This means that your save file was either corrupted or lost. To avoid this, refrain from editing files in the data folder (specifically **AddressBook.json** and **ArticleBook.json** files which contain the saved contacts and articles respectively, from previous sessions) unless you are sure about what you are doing.
* To mitigate possible accidental data corruption which may result in the deletion of any of the save files, please make a copy of the data files after every session where major changes were made, so that in the event the most recent data is lost, you would still have a recent data file which can then be added back into the data folder located at the working directory of the PressPlanner.jar file and be loaded up into the application.
