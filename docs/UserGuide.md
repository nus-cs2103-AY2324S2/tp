# CLInic User Guide

Welcome to **CLInic**, your digital assistant for managing patients and appointments! CLInic is a desktop app designed for clinic assistants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still offering the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br/> <br/>If you're familiar with digitalized software or have used a CLI before, you'll find CLInic intuitive. Don't worry if you're new to CLI; we'll guide you through every step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. System Requirements: Ensure you have [**Java 11**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) or above installed on your computer.

1. Download the latest `CLInic.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/releases).

1. Save the file to a location on your computer that will serve as your home folder for CLInic.

1. Open a command terminal on your computer. If you're unsure how to do this, we'll walk you through it.
   * **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.
   * **MacOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`.
   * **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `CLInic.jar` file. If you saved it in your `Downloads` folder, you can use the following commands:
   * **Windows**: `cd Downloads`
   * **MacOS**: `cd ~/Downloads`
   * **Linux**: `cd ~/Downloads`

1. Type `java -jar CLInic.jar` command into terminal to run the application.<br>
      A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
      ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.

   * `addPatient n/John Doe i/T0123456A b/2001-05-02 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to CLInic.

   * `deletePatient T0123456A` : Deletes patient with NRIC T0123456A and corresponding appointments.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addPatient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name OR NRIC is searched at once. e.g. `n/ Bob i/ T0123456A` is illegal
* Partial words will be matched only if the start of the word is the same e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
* For name search: patients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `n/ Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* For NRIC search: patients matching the given keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `n/ T0` will return `T0123456A`, `T0234567B`
  e.g. `n/ T01 T012` will NOT return `T0123456A` as the given keyword is `T01 T012`

Examples:
* `findPatient i/ S9` returns patients with NRICs `S9876543A` and `S9765432A`
* `findPatient n/ John` returns patients with names `john` and `John Doe`

### Editing the data file

CLInic data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/CLInic.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CLInic will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CLInic to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CLInic home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
