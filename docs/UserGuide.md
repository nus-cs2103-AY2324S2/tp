1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HRConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hrconnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add_applicant /name John Doe /phone 98765432 /email johnd@example.com /address 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 /role SWE /tag friends` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the HRConnect.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* When users input a command along with its arguments, it will be trimmed (remove leading whitespace, trailing whitespace, and whitespace in between words when there are more than one space) and converted to lowercase for parsing.

* When parsing arguments: “John Doe “, “John   Doe”, and “   John   Doe” will all be converted to “john doe”.

* When parsing commands: “/FILTER”, “/FILTER   stage_one ”, “    /FILTER STAGE_ONE   ” will all be converted to “/filter stage_one”.

* Words in angle brackets `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `/filter <Tag>`, `<Tag>` is a parameter which can be used as `/filter initial_application`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `/name NAME [/tag TAG]` can be used as `/name John Doe /tag friend` or as `/name John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order for `add_applicant` and `edit_applicant` commands.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/name NAME /phone PHONE_NUMBER`, `/phone PHONE_NUMBER /name NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters must be in strict order for `filter`, `note`, `export`, and `tag` command.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Filtering applicants by tag : `/filter`
Filter through contact list based on what role or stage the applicant is in.

### Exporting applicants contacts : `/export`
Use filter or find to isolate the applicants that match the desired stage or role or name. Export will then extract those applicants' contacts into an external JSON file.

HRConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hrconnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HRConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HRConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
