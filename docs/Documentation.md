# Documentation Guide

* We use [**MarkBind**](https://markbind.org/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder contains the source files for the documentation website.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Working with Forked MarkBind sites](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind-forked-sites.html) for project documentation.

**Style guidance:**

* Follow the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).
